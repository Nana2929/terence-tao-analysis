\section{Local maxima, local minima, and derivatives}\label{sec 10.2}

\begin{definition}[Local maxima and minima]\label{10.2.1}
    Let \(X\) be a subset of \(\mathbf{R}\), and let \(f : X \to \mathbf{R}\) be a function, and let \(x_0 \in X\).
    We say that \(f\) attains a \emph{local maximum} at \(x_0\) iff there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that the restriction \(f|_{X \cap (x_0 - \delta, x_0 + \delta)}\) of \(f\) to \(X \cap (x_0 - \delta, x_0 + \delta)\) attains a maximum at \(x_0\).
    We say that \(f\) attains a \emph{local minimum} at \(x_0\) iff there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that the restriction \(f|_{X \cap (x_0 - \delta, x_0 + \delta)}\) of \(f\) to \(X \cap (x_0 - \delta, x_0 + \delta)\) attains a minimum at \(x_0\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{10.2.2}
    If \(f\) attains a maximum at \(x_0\), we sometimes say that \(f\) attains a \emph{global} maximum at \(x_0\), in order to distinguish it from the local maxima defined in Definition \ref{10.2.1}.
    Note that if \(f\) attains a global maximum at \(x_0\), then it certainly also attains a local maximum at this \(x_0\), and similarly for minima.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}\label{10.2.5}
    If \(f : X \to \mathbf{R}\) attains a local maximum at a point \(x_0\) in \(X\), and \(Y \subseteq X\) is a subset of \(X\) which contains \(x_0\), then the restriction \(f|_Y : Y \to \mathbf{R}\) also attains a local maximum at \(x_0\).
    Similarly for minima.
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}[Local extrema are stationary]\label{10.2.6}
    Let \(a < b\) be real numbers, and let \(f : (a, b) \to \mathbf{R}\) be a function.
    If \(x_0 \in (a, b)\), \(f\) is differentiable at \(x_0\), and \(f\) attains either a local maximum or local minimum at \(x_0\), then \(f'(x_0) = 0\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose \(f\) attains local maximum at \(x_0\).
    Then by Definition \ref{10.2.1} we know that
    \[
        \exists\ \delta \in \mathbf{R}^+ : \forall\ x \in (a, b) \cap (x_0 - \delta, x_0 + \delta), f(x) \leq f(x_0).
    \]
    Since \(f\) is differentiable at \(x_0\), by Definition \ref{10.1.1} we know that
    \[
        \lim_{x \to x_0 ; x \in (a, b) \setminus \{x_0\}} \frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0} = f'(x_0)
    \]
    By Definition \ref{9.3.6} we know that \(\forall\ \varepsilon \in \mathbf{R}^+\), \(\exists\ \delta' \in \mathbf{R}^+\) such that
    \[
        \forall\ x \in (a, b) \setminus \{x_0\}, \abs*{x - x_0} < \delta' \implies \abs*{\frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0} - f'(x_0)} \leq \varepsilon.
    \]
    In particular, we have
    \[
        \forall\ x \in (a, b) \cap (x_0, x_0 + \delta), \abs*{x - x_0} < \delta' \implies \abs*{\frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0} - f'(x_0)} \leq \varepsilon
    \]
    and
    \[
        \forall\ x \in (a, b) \cap (x_0 - \delta, x_0), \abs*{x - x_0} < \delta' \implies \abs*{\frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0} - f'(x_0)} \leq \varepsilon.
    \]
    Thus by Definition \ref{9.3.6} we must also have
    \[
        \lim_{x \to x_0 ; x \in (a, b) \cap (x_0, x_0 + \delta)} \frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0} = \lim_{x \to x_0 ; x \in (a, b) \cap (x_0 - \delta, x_0)} \frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0} = f'(x_0).
    \]
    Since
    \begin{align*}
                 & \forall\ x \in (a, b) \cap (x_0, x_0 + \delta)                                                                                       \\
        \implies & f(x) \leq f(x_0)                                                                                                                     \\
        \implies & f(x) - f(x_0) \leq 0                                                                                                                 \\
        \implies & \frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0} \leq 0                                                                                                 \\
        \implies & \lim_{x \to x_0 ; x \in (a, b) \cap (x_0, x_0 + \delta)} \frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0} \leq 0 & \text{(by Proposition \ref{9.3.14})} \\
        \implies & f'(x_0) \leq 0
    \end{align*}
    and
    \begin{align*}
                 & \forall\ x \in (a, b) \cap (x_0 - \delta, x_0)                                                                                        \\
        \implies & f(x) \leq f(x_0)                                                                                                                      \\
        \implies & f(x) - f(x_0) \leq 0                                                                                                                  \\
        \implies & \frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0} \geq 0                                                                                                  \\
        \implies & \lim_{x \to x_0 ; x \in (a, b) \cap (x_0 - \delta, x_0)} \frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0} \geq 0, & \text{(by Proposition \ref{9.3.14})} \\
        \implies & f'(x_0) \geq 0.
    \end{align*}
    we must have \(f'(x_0) = 0\).
    Similar arguments work for the case \(f\) attains local minimum at \(x_0\).
\end{proof}

\begin{note}
    Note that \(f\) must be differentiable for this proposition to work.
    Also, this proposition does not work if the open interval \((a, b)\) is replaced by a closed interval \([a, b]\).
    For instance, the function \(f : [1, 2] \to \mathbf{R}\) defined by \(f(x) \coloneqq x\) has a local maximum at \(x_0 = 2\) and a local minimum \(x_0 = 1\) (in fact, these local extrema are global extrema), but at both points the derivative is \(f'(x_0) = 1\), not \(f'(x_0) = 0\).
    Thus the endpoints of an interval can be local maxima or minima even if the derivative is not zero there.
    Finally, the converse of this proposition is false.
\end{note}

\begin{theorem}[Rolle's theorem]\label{10.2.7}
    Let \(a < b\) be real numbers, and let \(g : [a, b] \to \mathbf{R}\) be a continuous function which is differentiable on \((a, b)\).
    Suppose also that \(g(a) = g(b)\).
    Then there exists an \(x \in (a, b)\) such that \(g'(x) = 0\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Since \(g\) is continuous on \([a, b]\), by Proposition \ref{9.6.7} \(g\) attains its maximum at some point \(x_{\max} \in [a, b]\), and also attains its minimum at some point \(x_{\min} \in [a, b]\).
    If \(x_{\min} \in \{a, b\} \land x_{\max} \in \{a, b\}\), then by Definition \ref{9.6.5} we have \(\forall\ x \in [a, b]\), \(g(x) = g(a) = g(b)\), and by Theorem \ref{10.1.13}(a) we know that \(g'(x) = 0\).
    So suppose that at least one of \(x_{\min}, x_{\max} \notin \{a, b\}\), i.e., \(x_{\min} \in (a, b) \lor x_{\max} \in (a, b)\).
    If \(x_{\min} \in (a, b)\), then by Proposition \ref{10.2.6} we know that \(f'(x_{\min}) = 0\).
    Similarly, if \(x_{\max} \in (a, b)\), then by Proposition \ref{10.2.6} we know that \(f'(x_{\max}) = 0\).
    Thus there exists an \(x \in (a, b)\) such that \(g'(x) = 0\).
\end{proof}
