\section{Inverse functions and derivatives}\label{sec 10.4}

\begin{lemma}\label{10.4.1}
    Let \(f : X \to Y\) be an invertible function, with inverse \(f^{-1} : Y \to X\).
    Suppose that \(x_0 \in X\) and \(y_0 \in Y\) are such that \(y_0 = f(x_0)\)
    (which also implies that \(x_0 = f^{-1}(y_0)\)).
    If \(f\) is differentiable at \(x_0\), and \(f^{-1}\) is differentiable at \(y_0\), then
    \[
        (f^{-1})'(y_0) = \frac{1}{f'(x_0)}.
    \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    From the chain rule (Theorem \ref{10.1.15}) we have
    \[
        (f^{-1} \circ f)'(x_0) = (f^{-1})'(y_0) f'(x_0).
    \]
    But \(f^{-1} \circ f\) is the identity function on \(X\), and hence by Theorem \ref{10.1.13}(b) \((f^{-1} \circ f)'(x_0) = 1\).
    The claim follows.
\end{proof}
