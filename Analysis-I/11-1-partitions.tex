\begin{definition}\label{11.1.1}
    Let \(X\) be a subset of \(\mathbf{R}\).
    We say that \(X\) is \emph{connected} iff the following property is true:
    whenever \(x, y\) are elements in \(X\) such that \(x < y\), the bounded interval \([x, y]\) is a subset of \(X\)
    (i.e., every number between \(x\) and \(y\) is also in \(X\)).
