\section{Consequences of the fundamental theorems}\label{sec 11.10}

\begin{proposition}[Integration by parts formula]\label{11.10.1}
    Let \(I = [a, b]\), and let \(F : [a, b] \to \mathbf{R}\) and \(G : [a, b] \to \mathbf{R}\) be differentiable functions on \([a, b]\) such that \(F'\) and \(G'\) are Riemann integrable on \(I\).
    Then we have
    \[
        \int_{[a, b]} F G' = F(b) G(b) - F(a) G(a) - \int_{[a, b]} F' G.
    \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Since \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(F'\) and \(F'\) is Riemann integrable on \([a, b]\), by Theorem \ref{11.9.1} we know that \(F\) is continuous on \([a, b]\).
    Similarly \(G\) is continuous on \([a, b]\).
    By Corollarly \ref{11.5.2} we know that \(F\) and \(G\) are Riemann integrable on \([a, b]\).
    By Theorem \ref{11.4.5} we know that \(F G'\) and \(F' G\) are Riemann integrable on \([a, b]\).
    By Theorem \ref{10.1.13}(d) we have \((FG)' = F' G + F G'\).
    Thus by Theorem \ref{11.4.1}(a) \((FG)'\) is Riemann integrable on \([a, b]\) and
    \begin{align*}
        \int_{[a, b]} (F G') & = \int_{[a, b]} ((FG)' - F' G)                                                        \\
                             & = \int_{[a, b]} ((FG)') - \int_{[a, b]} (F' G)  & \text{(by Theorem \ref{11.4.1}(c))} \\
                             & = F(b) G(b) - F(a) G(a) - \int_{[a, b]} (F' G). & \text{(by Theorem \ref{11.9.4})}
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}
