\section{Piecewise constant functions}\label{sec 11.2}

\begin{definition}[Constant functions]\label{11.2.1}
    Let \(X\) be a subset of \(\mathbf{R}\), and let \(f : X \to \mathbf{R}\) be a function.
    We say that \(f\) is \emph{constant} iff there exists a real number \(c\) such that \(f(x) = c\) for all \(x \in X\).
    If \(E\) is a subset of \(X\), we say that \(f\) is \emph{constant on} \(E\) if the restriction \(f|_E\) of \(f\) to \(E\) is constant, in other words there exists a real number \(c\) such that \(f(x) = c\) for all \(x \in E\).
    We refer to \(c\) as the \emph{constant value} of \(f\) on \(E\).
