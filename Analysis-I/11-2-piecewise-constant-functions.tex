\section{Piecewise constant functions}\label{sec 11.2}

\begin{definition}[Constant functions]\label{11.2.1}
    Let \(X\) be a subset of \(\mathbf{R}\), and let \(f : X \to \mathbf{R}\) be a function.
    We say that \(f\) is \emph{constant} iff there exists a real number \(c\) such that \(f(x) = c\) for all \(x \in X\).
    If \(E\) is a subset of \(X\), we say that \(f\) is \emph{constant on} \(E\) if the restriction \(f|_E\) of \(f\) to \(E\) is constant, in other words there exists a real number \(c\) such that \(f(x) = c\) for all \(x \in E\).
    We refer to \(c\) as the \emph{constant value} of \(f\) on \(E\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{11.2.2}
    If \(E\) is a non-empty set, then a function \(f\) which is constant on \(E\) can have only one constant value;
    However, if \(E\) is empty, every real number \(c\) is a constant value for \(f\) on \(E\).
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Piecewise constant functions I]\label{11.2.3}
    Let \(I\) be a bounded interval, let \(f : I \to \mathbf{R}\) be a function, and let \(\mathbf{P}\) be a partition of \(I\).
    We say that \(f\) is \emph{piecewise constant with respect to \(\mathbf{P}\)} if for every \(J \in \mathbf{P}\), \(f\) is constant on \(J\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Piecewise constant functions II]\label{11.2.5}
    Let \(I\) be a bounded interval, and let \(f : I \to \mathbf{R}\) be a function.
    We say that \(f\) is \emph{piecewise constant on \(I\)} if there exists a partition \(\mathbf{P}\) of \(I\) such that \(f\) is piecewise constant with respect to \(\mathbf{P}\).
\end{definition}
