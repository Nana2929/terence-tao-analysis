\section{The Peano axioms}

\begin{note}
We now present one standard way to define the natural numbers, in terms of the \emph{Peano axioms}, which were first laid out by Giuseppe Peano (1858â€“1932).
This is not the only way to define the natural numbers.
For instance, another approach is to talk about the cardinality of finite sets, for instance one could take a set of five elements and define \(5\) to be the number of elements in that set.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
In some texts the natural numbers start at \(1\) instead of \(0\), but this is a matter of notational convention more than anything else.
In this text we shall refer to the set \(\{1, 2, 3,...\}\) as the positive integers \(\mathds{Z}^+\) rather than the natural numbers.
Natural numbers are sometimes also known as \emph{whole numbers}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
In mathematics we try not to define a variable more than once in any given setting, as it can often lead to confusion;
many of the statements which were true for the old value of the variable can now become false, and vice versa.
\end{note}

\begin{axiom}\label{2.1}
\(0\) is a natural number.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}\label{2.2}
If \(n\) is a natural number, then \(n++\) is also a natural number.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}\label{2.3}
\(0\) is not the successor of any natural number;
i.e., we have \(n++ \neq 0\) for every natural number \(n\).
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}\label{2.4}
Different natural numbers must have different successors;
i.e., if \(n\), \(m\) are natural numbers and \(n \neq m\), then \(n++ \neq m++\).
Equivalently, if \(n++ = m++\), then we must have \(n = m\).
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[Principle of mathematical induction]\label{2.5}
Let \(P(n)\) be any property pertaining to a natural number \(n\).
Suppose that \(P(0)\) is true, and suppose that whenever \(P(n)\) is true, \(P(n++)\) is also true.
Then \(P(n)\) is true for every natural number \(n\).
\end{axiom}

\begin{note}
Axioms \ref{2.1}-\ref{2.5} are known as the Peano axioms for the natural numbers.
