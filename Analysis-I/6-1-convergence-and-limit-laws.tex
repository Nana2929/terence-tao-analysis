\begin{definition}[Distance between two real numbers]\label{6.1.1}
Given two real numbers \(x\) and \(y\), we define their distance \(d(x, y)\) to be \(d(x, y) \coloneqq \abs*{x - y}\).
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
Clearly Definition \ref{6.1.1} is consistent with Definition \ref{4.3.2}.
Further, Proposition \ref{4.3.3} works just as well for real numbers as it does for rationals, because the real numbers obey all the rules of algebra that the rationals do.
\end{note}

\begin{definition}[\(\varepsilon\)-close real numbers]\label{6.1.2}
Let \(\varepsilon > 0\) be a real number.
We say that two real numbers \(x, y\) are \emph{\(\varepsilon\)-close} iff we have \(d(y, x) \leq \varepsilon\).
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
Again, it is clear that Definition \ref{6.1.2} is consistent with Definition \ref{4.3.4}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
Now let \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) be a sequence of real numbers;
i.e., we assign a real number \(a_n\) for every integer \(n \geq m\).
The starting index \(m\) is some integer;
usually this will be \(1\), but in some cases we will start from some index other than \(1\).
(The choice of label used to index this sequence is unimportant; we could use for instance \((a_k)_{k = m}^{\infty}\) and this would represent exactly the same sequence as \((a_n)_{n = m}^{\infty}\).
We can define the notion of a Cauchy sequence in the same manner as before.
\end{note}

\begin{definition}[Cauchy sequences of reals]\label{6.1.3}
Let \(\varepsilon > 0\) be a real number.
A sequence \((a_n)_{n = N}^\infty\) of real numbers starting at some integer index \(N\) is said to be \emph{\(\varepsilon\)-steady} iff \(a_j\) and \(a_k\) are \(\varepsilon\)-close for every \(j, k \geq N\).
A sequence \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) starting at some integer index \(m\) is said to be \emph{eventually \(\varepsilon\)-steady} iff there exists an \(N \geq m\) such that \((a_n)_{n = N}^\infty\) is \(\varepsilon\)-steady.
We say that \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) is a \emph{Cauchy sequence} iff it is eventually \(\varepsilon\)-steady for every \(\varepsilon > 0\).
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
To put it another way, a sequence \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) of real numbers is a Cauchy sequence if, for every real \(\varepsilon > 0\), there exists an \(N \geq m\) such that \(\abs*{a_n - a_n'} \leq \varepsilon\) for all \(n, n' \geq N\).
These definitions are consistent with the corresponding definitions for rational numbers (Definitions \ref{5.1.3}, \ref{5.1.6}, \ref{5.1.8}), although verifying consistency for Cauchy sequences takes a little bit of care.
\end{note}

\begin{proposition}\label{6.1.4}
Let \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) be a sequence of rational numbers starting at some integer index \(m\).
Then \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) is a Cauchy sequence in the sense of Definition \ref{5.1.8} if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence in the sense of Definition \ref{6.1.3}.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Suppose first that \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) is a Cauchy sequence in the sense of Definition \ref{6.1.3};
then it is eventually \(\varepsilon\)-steady for every real \(\varepsilon > 0\).
In particular, it is eventually \(\varepsilon\)-steady for every rational \(\varepsilon > 0\), which makes it a Cauchy sequence in the sense of Definition \ref{5.1.8}.

Now suppose that \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) is a Cauchy sequence in the sense of Definition \ref{5.1.8};
then it is eventually \(\varepsilon\)-steady for every rational \(\varepsilon > 0\).
If \(\varepsilon > 0\) is a real number, then there exists a rational \(\varepsilon' > 0\) which is smaller than \(\varepsilon\), by Proposition \ref{5.4.12}.
Since \(\varepsilon'\) is rational, we know that \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) is eventually \(\varepsilon'\)-steady;
since \(\varepsilon' < \varepsilon\), this implies that \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) is eventually \(\varepsilon\)-steady.
Since \(\varepsilon\) is an arbitrary positive real number, we thus see that \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) is a Cauchy sequence in the sense of Definition \ref{6.1.3}.
\end{proof}

\begin{note}
Because of Proposition \ref{6.1.4}, we will no longer care about the distinction between Definition \ref{5.1.8} and Definition \ref{6.1.3}, and view the concept of a Cauchy sequence as a single unified concept.
