\section{The Extended real number system}\label{sec 6.2}

\begin{definition}[Extended real number system]\label{6.2.1}
The \emph{extended real number system \(\mathds{R}^*\)} is the real line \(\mathds{R}\) with two additional elements attached, called \(+\infty\) and \(-\infty\).
These elements are distinct from each other and also distinct from every real number.
An extended real number \(x\) is called \emph{finite} iff it is a real number, and \emph{infinite} iff it is equal to \(+\infty\) or \(-\infty\).
(This definition is not directly related to the notion of finite and infinite sets in Section \ref{sec 3.6}, though it is of course similar in spirit.)
