\section{Subsequences}\label{sec 6.6}

\begin{definition}[Subsequences]\label{6.6.1}
Let \((a_n)_{n = 0}^\infty\) and \((b_n)_{n = 0}^\infty\) be sequences of real numbers.
We say that \((b_n)_{n = 0}^\infty\) is a \emph{subsequence} of \((a_n)_{n = 0}^\infty\) iff there exists a function \(f : \mathbf{N} \to \mathbf{N}\) which is strictly increasing (i.e., \(f(n + 1) > f(n)\) for all \(n \in \mathbf{N}\)) such that
\[
    b_n = a_{f(n)} \text{ for all } n \in \mathbf{N}.
\]
\end{definition}
