\section{Real exponentiation, part II}\label{sec 6.7}

\begin{lemma}[Continuity of exponentiation]\label{6.7.1}
Let \(x > 0\), and let \(\alpha\) be a real number.
Let \((q_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) be any sequence of rational numbers converging to \(\alpha\).
Then \((x^{q_n})_{n = 1}^\infty\) is also a convergent sequence.
Furthermore, if \((q_n')_{n = 1}^\infty\) is any other sequence of rational numbers converging to \(\alpha\), then \((x^{q_n'})_{n = 1}^\infty\) has the same limit as \((x^{q_n})_{n = 1}^\infty\):
\[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} x^{q_n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} x^{q_n'}.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
There are three cases: \(x < 1\), \(x = 1\), and \(x > 1\).
The case \(x = 1\) is rather easy (because then \(x^q = 1\) for all rational \(q\)).

We first show that if \(x > 1\) then \((x^{q_n})_{n = 1}^\infty\) converges.
By Proposition \ref{6.4.18} it is enough to show that \((x^{q_n})_{n = 1}^\infty\) is a Cauchy sequence.

To do this, we need to estimate the distance between \(x^{q_n}\) and \(x^{q_m}\);
let us say for the time being that \(q_n \geq q_m\), so that \(x^{q_n} \geq x^{q_m}\) (since \(x > 1\)).
We have
\[
    d(x^{q_n}, x^{q_m}) = x^{q_n} - x^{q_m} = x^{q_m} (x^{q_n - q_m} - 1).
\]
Since \((q_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) is a convergent sequence, it has some upper bound \(M\);
since \(x > 1\), we have \(x^{q_m} \leq x^M\).
Thus
\[
    d(x^{q_n}, x^{q_m}) = \abs*{x^{q_n} - x^{q_m}} \leq x^M (x^{q_n - q_m} - 1).
\]
Now let \(\varepsilon > 0\).
We know by Lemma \ref{6.5.3} that the sequence \((x^{1 / k})_{k = 1}^\infty\) is eventually \(\varepsilon x^{-M}\)-close to \(1\).
Thus there exists some \(K \geq 1\) such that
\[
    \abs*{x^{1 / K} - 1} \leq \varepsilon x^{-M}.
\]
Now since \((q_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) is convergent, it is a Cauchy sequence, and so there is an \(N \geq 1\) such that \(q_n\) and \(q_m\) are \(1 / K\)-close for all \(n, m \geq N\).
Thus we have
\[
    d(x^{q_n}, x^{q_m}) \leq x^M (x^{q_n - q_m} - 1) \leq x^M (x^{1 / K} - 1) \leq x^M \varepsilon x^{-M} = \varepsilon.
\]
for every \(n, m \geq N\) such that \(q_n \geq q_m\).
By symmetry we also have this bound when \(n, m \geq N\) and \(q_n \leq q_m\).
Thus the sequence \((x^{q_n})_{n = 1}^\infty\) is \(\varepsilon\)-steady.
Thus the sequence \((x^{q_n})_{n = 1}^\infty\) is eventually \(\varepsilon\)-steady for every \(\varepsilon > 0\), and is thus a Cauchy sequence as desired.
This proves the convergence of \((x^{q_n})_{n = 1}^\infty\) when \(x > 1\).

Next we show that if \(x < 1\) then \((x^{q_n})_{n = 1}^\infty\) also converges.
By Proposition \ref{6.4.18} it is enough to show that \((x^{q_n})_{n = 1}^\infty\) is a Cauchy sequence.

To do this, we need to estimate the distance between \(x^{q_n}\) and \(x^{q_m}\);
let us say for the time being that \(q_n \leq q_m\), so that \(x^{q_n} \geq x^{q_m}\) (since \(x < 1\)).
We have
\[
    d(x^{q_n}, x^{q_m}) = x^{q_n} - x^{q_m} = x^{q_m} (x^{q_n - q_m} - 1).
\]
Since \((q_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) is a convergent sequence, it has some lower bound \(M\);
since \(x < 1\), we have \(x^{q_m} \leq x^M\).
Thus
\[
    d(x^{q_n}, x^{q_m}) = \abs*{x^{q_n} - x^{q_m}} \leq x^M (x^{q_n - q_m} - 1).
\]
Now let \(\varepsilon > 0\).
We know by Lemma \ref{6.5.3} that the sequence \((x^{1 / k})_{k = 1}^\infty\) is eventually \(\varepsilon x^{-M}\)-close to \(1\).
Thus there exists some \(K \geq 1\) such that
\[
    \abs*{x^{1 / K} - 1} \leq \varepsilon x^{-M}.
\]
Now since \((q_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) is convergent, it is a Cauchy sequence, and so there is an \(N \geq 1\) such that \(q_n\) and \(q_m\) are \(1 / K\)-close for all \(n, m \geq N\).
Thus we have
\[
    d(x^{q_n}, x^{q_m}) \leq x^M (x^{q_n - q_m} - 1) \leq x^M (x^{1 / K} - 1) \leq x^M \varepsilon x^{-M} = \varepsilon.
\]
for every \(n, m \geq N\) such that \(q_n \leq q_m\).
By symmetry we also have this bound when \(n, m \geq N\) and \(q_n \geq q_m\).
Thus the sequence \((x^{q_n})_{n = 1}^\infty\) is \(\varepsilon\)-steady.
Thus the sequence \((x^{q_n})_{n = 1}^\infty\) is eventually \(\varepsilon\)-steady for every \(\varepsilon > 0\), and is thus a Cauchy sequence as desired.
This proves the convergence of \((x^{q_n})_{n = 1}^\infty\) when \(x < 1\).

Now we prove the second claim.
It will suffice to show that
\[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} x^{q_n - q_n'} = 1,
\]
since the claim would then follow from limit laws
(since \(x^{q_n} = x^{q_n - q_n'} x^{q_n'}\)).

Write \(r_n \coloneqq q_n - q_n'\);
by limit laws we know that \((r_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) converges to \(0\).
We have to show that for every \(\varepsilon > 0\), the sequence \((x^{r_n})_{n = 1}^\infty\) is eventually \(\varepsilon\)-close to \(1\).
But from Lemma \ref{6.5.3} we know that the sequence \((x^{1 / k})_{k = 1}^\infty\) is eventually \(\varepsilon\)-close to \(1\).
Since \(\lim_{k \to \infty} x^{-1 / k}\) is also equal to \(1\) by Lemma \ref{6.5.3}, we know that \((x^{-1 / k})_{k = 1}^\infty\) is also eventually \(\varepsilon\)-close to \(1\).
Thus we can find a \(K\) such that \(x^{1 / K}\) and \(x^{-1 / K}\) are both \(\varepsilon\)-close to \(1\).
But since \((r_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) is convergent to \(0\), it is eventually \(1 / K\)-close to \(0\), so that eventually \(-1 / K \leq r_n \leq 1 / K\), and thus when \(x > 1\) we have \(x^{-1 / K} \leq x^{r_n} \leq x^{1 / K}\), when \(x < 1\) we have \(x^{1 / K} \leq x^{r_n} \leq x^{-1 / K}\).
In particular \(x^{r_n}\) is also eventually \(\varepsilon\)-close to \(1\) (see Proposition \ref{4.3.7}(f)), as desired.
