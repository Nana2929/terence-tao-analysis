\section{Limits at infinity}\label{sec 9.10}

\begin{definition}[Infinite adherent points]\label{9.10.1}
    Let \(X\) be a subset of \(\mathbf{R}\).
    We say that \(+\infty\) is \emph{adherent} to \(X\) iff for every \(M \in \mathbf{R}\) there exists an \(x \in X\) such that \(x > M\);
    we say that \(-\infty\) is \emph{adherent} to \(X\) iff for every \(M \in \mathbf{R}\) there exists an \(x \in X\) such that \(x < M\).
\end{definition}
