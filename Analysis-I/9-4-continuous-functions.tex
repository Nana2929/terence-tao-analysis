\section{Continuous functions}\label{sec 9.4}

\begin{definition}[Continuity]\label{9.4.1}
    Let \(X\) be a subset of \(\mathbf{R}\), and let \(f : X \to \mathbf{R}\) be a function.
    Let \(x_0\) be an element of \(X\).
    We say that \(f\) is \emph{continuous at \(x_0\)} iff we have
    \[
        \lim_{x \to x_0 ; x \in X} f(x) = f(x_0);
    \]
    in other words, the limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) converges to \(x_0\) in \(X\) exists and is equal to \(f(x_0)\).
    We say that \(f\) is \emph{continuous on \(X\)} (or simply \emph{continuous}) iff \(f\) is continuous at \(x_0\) for every \(x_0 \in X\).
    We say that \(f\) is \emph{discontinuous at \(x_0\)} iff it is not continuous at \(x_0\).
