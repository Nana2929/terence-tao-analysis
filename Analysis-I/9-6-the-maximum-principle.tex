\section{The maximum principle}\label{sec 9.6}

\begin{definition}\label{9.6.1}
    Let \(X\) be a subset of \(\mathbf{R}\), and let \(f : X \to \mathbf{R}\) be a function.
    We say that \(f\) is \emph{bounded from above} iff there exists a real number \(M\) such that \(f(x) \leq M\) for all \(x \in X\).
    We say that \(f\) is \emph{bounded from below} iff there exists a real number \(M\) such that \(f(x) \geq -M\) for all \(x \in X\).
    We say that \(f\) is \emph{bounded} iff there exists a real number \(M\) such that \(\abs*{f(x)} \leq M\) for all \(x \in X\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{9.6.2}
    A function is bounded if and only if it is bounded both from above and below.
    Also, a function \(f : X \to \mathbf{R}\) is bounded if and only if its image \(f(X)\) is a bounded set in the sense of Definition \ref{9.1.22}.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{9.6.3}
    Let \(a < b\) be real numbers, and let \(f : [a, b] \to \mathbf{R}\) be a function continuous on \([a, b]\).
    Then \(f\) is a bounded function.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose for sake of contradiction that \(f\) is not bounded.
    Thus for every real number \(M\) there exists an element \(x \in [a, b]\) such that \(\abs*{f(x)} \geq M\).

    In particular, for every natural number \(n\), the set \(\{x \in [a, b] : \abs*{f(x)} \geq n\}\) is non-empty.
    We can thus choose a sequence \((x_n)_{n = 0}^\infty\) in \([a, b]\) such that \(\abs*{f(x_n)} \geq n\) for all \(n\).
    This sequence lies in \([a, b]\), and so by Theorem \ref{9.1.24} there exists a subsequence \((x_{n_j})_{j = 0}^\infty\) which converges to some limit \(L \in [a, b]\), where \(n_0 < n_1 < n_2 < \dots\) is an increasing sequence of natural numbers.
    In particular, we see that \(n_j \geq j\) for all \(j \in \mathbf{N}\) (use induction).

    Since \(f\) is continuous on \([a, b]\), it is continuous at \(L\), and in particular we see that
    \[
        \lim_{j \to \infty} f(x_{n_j}) = f(L).
    \]
    Thus the sequence \((f(x_{n_j}))_{j = 0}^\infty\) is convergent, and hence it is bounded.
    On the other hand, we know from the construction that \(\abs*{f(x_{n_j})} \geq n_j \geq j\) for all \(j\), and hence the sequence \((f(x_{n_j}))_{j = 0}^\infty\) is not bounded, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}\label{9.6.4}
    There are two things about the proof of Lemma \ref{9.6.3} that are worth noting.
    Firstly, it shows how useful the Heine-Borel theorem (Theorem \ref{9.1.24}) is.
    Secondly, it is an indirect proof;
    it doesn't say \emph{how} to find the bound for \(f\), but it shows that having \(f\) unbounded leads to a contradiction.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Maxima and minima]\label{9.6.5}
    Let \(X\) be a subset of \(\mathbf{R}\), and let \(f : X \to \mathbf{R}\) be a function, and let \(x_0 \in X\).
    We say that \emph{\(f\) attains its maximum at \(x_0\)} if we have \(f(x_0) \geq f(x)\) for all \(x \in X\)
    (i.e., the value of \(f\) at the point \(x_0\) is larger than or equal to the value of \(f\) at any other point in \(X\)).
    We say that \emph{\(f\) attains its minimum at \(x_0\)} if we have \(f(x_0) \leq f(x)\) for all \(x \in X\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{9.6.6}
    If a function attains its maximum somewhere, then it must be bounded from above.
    Similarly if it attains its minimum somewhere, then it must be bounded from below.
    These notions of maxima and minima are \emph{global}.
