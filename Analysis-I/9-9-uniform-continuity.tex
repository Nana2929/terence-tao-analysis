\section{Uniform continuity}\label{sec 9.9}

\begin{definition}[Uniform continuity]\label{9.9.2}
    Let \(X\) be a subset of \(\mathbf{R}\), and let \(f : X \to \mathbf{R}\) be a function.
    We say that \(f\) is \emph{uniformly continuous} if, for every \(\varepsilon > 0\), there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that \(f(x)\) and \(f(x_0)\) are \(\varepsilon\)-close whenever \(x, x_0 \in X\) are two points in \(X\) which are \(\delta\)-close.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{9.9.3}
    This definition should be compared with the notion of continuity.
    From Proposition \ref{9.4.7}(c), we know that a function \(f\) is \emph{continuous} if for every \(\varepsilon > 0\), and every \(x_0 \in X\), there is a \(\delta > 0\) such that \(f(x)\) and \(f(x_0)\) are \(\varepsilon\)-close whenever \(x \in X\) is \(\delta\)-close to \(x_0\).
    The difference between uniform continuity and continuity is that in uniform continuity one can take a single \(\delta\) which works for all \(x_0 \in X\);
    for ordinary continuity, each \(x_0 \in X\) might use a different \(\delta\).
    Thus every uniformly continuous function is continuous, but not conversely.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Equivalent sequences]\label{9.9.5}
    Let \(m\) be an integer, let \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) and \((b_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) be two sequences of real numbers, and let \(\varepsilon > 0\) be given.
    We say that \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) is \(\varepsilon\)-close to \((b_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) iff \(a_n\) is \(\varepsilon\)-close to \(b_n\) for each \(n \geq m\).
    We say that \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) is eventually \(\varepsilon\)-close to \((b_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) iff there exists an \(N \geq m\) such that the sequences \((a_n)_{n = N}^\infty\) and \((b_n)_{n = N}^\infty\) are \(\varepsilon\)-close.
    Two sequences \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) and \((b_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) are equivalent iff for each \(\varepsilon > 0\), the sequences \((a_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) and \((b_n)_{n = m}^\infty\) are eventually \(\varepsilon\)-close.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{9.9.6}
    One could debate whether \(\varepsilon\) should be assumed to be rational or real, but a minor modification of Proposition \ref{6.1.4} shows that this does not make any difference to the above definitions.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{9.9.7}
    Let \((a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) and \((b_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) be sequences of real numbers
    (not necessarily bounded or convergent).
    Then \((a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) and \((b_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) are equivalent if and only if \(\lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n - b_n) = 0\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{align*}
             & (a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty = (b_n)_{n = 1}^\infty                                                                              \\
        \iff & \forall\ \varepsilon \in \mathbf{R}^+, \exists\ N \in \mathbf{N} \land N \geq 1 :   & \text{(by Definition \ref{9.9.5})} \\
             & (\forall\ n \in \mathbf{N} \land n \geq N, \abs*{a_n - b_n} \leq \varepsilon)                                            \\
        \iff & \forall\ \varepsilon \in \mathbf{R}^+, \exists\ N \in \mathbf{N} \land N \geq 1 :                                        \\
             & (\forall\ n \in \mathbf{N} \land n \geq N, \abs*{(a_n - b_n) - 0} \leq \varepsilon)                                      \\
        \iff & \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n - b_n) = 0.                                                & \text{(by Definition \ref{6.1.5})}
    \end{align*}
