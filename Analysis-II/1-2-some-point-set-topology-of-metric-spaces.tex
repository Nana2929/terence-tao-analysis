\section{Some point-set topology of metric spaces}\label{sec 1.2}

\begin{note}
    Having defined the operation of convergence on metric spaces, we now define a couple other related notions, including that of open set, closed set, interior, exterior, boundary, and adherent point.
    The study of such notions is known as \emph{point-set topology}.
\end{note}

\begin{definition}[Balls]\label{1.2.1}
    Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space, let \(x_0\) be a point in \(X\), and let \(r > 0\).
    We define the \emph{ball} \(B_{(X, d)}(x_0, r)\) in \(X\), centered at \(x_0\), and with radius \(r\), in the metric \(d\), to be the set
    \[
        B_{(X, d)}(x_0, r) \coloneqq \{x \in X : d(x, x_0) < r\}.
    \]
    When it is clear what the metric space \((X, d)\) is, we shall abbreviate \(B_{(X, d)}(x_0, r)\) as just \(B(x_0, r)\).
\end{definition}

\setcounter{theorem}{3}
\begin{remark}\label{1.2.4}
    Note that the smaller the radius \(r\), the smaller the ball \(B(x_0 , r)\).
    However, \(B(x_0 , r)\) always contains at least one point, namely the center \(x_0\), as long as \(r\) stays positive, thanks to Definition \ref{1.1.2}(a).
    (We don't consider balls of zero radius or negative radius since they are rather boring, being just the empty set.)
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Interior, exterior, boundary]\label{1.2.5}
    Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space, let \(E\) be a subset of \(X\), and let \(x_0\) be a point in \(X\).
    We say that \(x_0\) is an \emph{interior point of} \(E\) if there exists a radius \(r > 0\) such that \(B(x_0, r) \subseteq E\).
    We say that \(x_0\) is an \emph{exterior point of} \(E\) if there exists a radius \(r > 0\) such that \(B(x_0, r) \cap E = \emptyset\).
    We say that \(x_0\) is a \emph{boundary point of} \(E\) if it is neither an interior point nor an exterior point of \(E\).
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
    The set of all interior points of \(E\) is called the interior of \(E\) and is sometimes denoted \(\text{int}(E)\).
    The set of exterior points of \(E\) is called the exterior of \(E\) and is sometimes denoted \(\text{ext}(E)\).
    The set of boundary points of \(E\) is called the boundary of \(E\) and is sometimes denoted \(\partial E\).
\end{note}

\begin{remark}\label{1.2.6}
    If \(x_0\) is an interior point of \(E\), then \(x_0\) must actually be an element of \(E\), since balls \(B(x_0, r)\) always contain their center \(x_0\).
    Conversely, if \(x_0\) is an exterior point of \(E\), then \(x_0\) cannot be an element of \(E\).
    In particular it is not possible for \(x_0\) to simultaneously be an interior and an exterior point of \(E\).
    If \(x_0\) is a boundary point of \(E\), then it could be an element of \(E\), but it could also not lie in \(E\);
