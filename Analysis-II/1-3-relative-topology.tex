\begin{definition}[Relative topology]\label{1.3.3}
    Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space, let \(Y\) be a subset of \(X\), and let \(E\) be a subset of \(Y\).
    We say that \(E\) is \emph{relatively open with respect to \(Y\)} if it is open in the metric subspace \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\).
    Similarly, we say that \(E\) is \emph{relatively closed with respect to \(Y\)} if it is closed in the metric space \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\).
