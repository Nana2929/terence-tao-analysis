\section{Cauchy sequences and complete metric spaces}\label{sec 1.4}

\begin{definition}[Subsequences]\label{1.4.1}
    Suppose that \((x^{(n)})_{n = m}^\infty\) is a sequence of points in a metric space \((X, d)\).
    Suppose that \(n_1, n_2, n_3, \dots\) is an increasing sequence of integers which are at least as large as \(m\), thus
    \[
        m \leq n_1 < n_2 < n_3 < \dots.
    \]
    Then we call the sequence \((x^{(n_j)})_{j = 1}^\infty\) a subsequence of the original sequence \((x^{(n)})_{n = m}^\infty\).
\end{definition}
