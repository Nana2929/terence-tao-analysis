\section{Compact metric spaces}\label{sec 1.5}

\begin{definition}[Compactness]\label{1.5.1}
    A metric space \((X, d)\) is said to be \emph{compact} iff every sequence in \((X, d)\) has at least one convergent subsequence.
    A subset \(Y\) of a metric space \(X\) is said to be \emph{compact} if the subspace \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\) is compact.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{1.5.2}
    The notion of a set \(Y\) being compact is \emph{intrinsic}, in the sense that it only depends on the metric function \(d|_{Y \times Y}\) restricted to \(Y\), and not on the choice of the ambient space \(X\).
    The notions of completeness in Definition \ref{1.4.10}, and of boundedness below in Definition 1.5.3, are also intrinsic, but the notions of open and closed are not
    (see the discussion in Section \ref{sec 1.3}).
\end{remark}

\begin{note}
    Heine-Borel theorem shows that in the real line \(\mathbf{R}\) with the usual metric, every closed and bounded set is compact, and conversely every compact set is closed and bounded.
\end{note}

\begin{definition}[Bounded sets]\label{1.5.3}
    Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space, and let \(Y\) be a subset of \(X\).
    We say that \(Y\) is \emph{bounded} iff for every \(x \in X\) there exists a ball \(B(x, r)\) in \(X\) which contains \(Y\).
    We call \((X, d)\) bounded if \(X\) is bounded.
\end{definition}
