\section{Compact metric spaces}\label{sec 1.5}

\begin{definition}[Compactness]\label{1.5.1}
    A metric space \((X, d)\) is said to be \emph{compact} iff every sequence in \((X, d)\) has at least one convergent subsequence.
    A subset \(Y\) of a metric space \(X\) is said to be \emph{compact} if the subspace \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\) is compact.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{1.5.2}
    The notion of a set \(Y\) being compact is \emph{intrinsic}, in the sense that it only depends on the metric function \(d|_{Y \times Y}\) restricted to \(Y\), and not on the choice of the ambient space \(X\).
    The notions of completeness in Definition \ref{1.4.10}, and of boundedness below in Definition 1.5.3, are also intrinsic, but the notions of open and closed are not
    (see the discussion in Section \ref{sec 1.3}).
\end{remark}

\begin{note}
    Heine-Borel theorem shows that in the real line \(\mathbf{R}\) with the usual metric, every closed and bounded set is compact, and conversely every compact set is closed and bounded.
\end{note}

\begin{definition}[Bounded sets]\label{1.5.3}
    Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space, and let \(Y\) be a subset of \(X\).
    We say that \(Y\) is \emph{bounded} iff for every \(x \in X\) there exists a ball \(B(x, r)\) in \(X\) which contains \(Y\).
    We call \((X, d)\) bounded if \(X\) is bounded.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{1.5.4}
    Definition \ref{1.5.3} is compatible with the definition of a bounded set on \(\mathbf{R}\).
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}\label{1.5.5}
    Let \((X, d)\) be a compact metric space.
    Then \((X, d)\) is both complete and bounded.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    If \(X = \emptyset\), then every Cauchy sequence \((a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) in \((\emptyset, d)\) converges in \((\emptyset, d)\) trivially, thus by Definition \ref{1.4.10} \((\emptyset, d)\) is complete.
    Also, \(\forall\ x \in \emptyset\), \(\forall\ r \in \mathbf{R}^+\), we have \(\emptyset \subseteq B_{(\emptyset, d)}(x, r)\) (again the statement is trivially true), thus by Definition \ref{1.5.3} \((\emptyset, d)\) is bounded.

    Now suppose that \(X \neq \emptyset\).
    We show that \((X, d)\) is complete by contradiction.
    So suppose for sake of contradiction that \((X, d)\) is not complete.
    Then by Definition \ref{1.4.10} we know that there exists a Cauchy sequence \((a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) in \((X, d)\) does not converge to \(X\).
    We know that \((a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) must converge by Exercise \ref{ex 1.4.8}.
    Since \((X, d)\) is compact, by Definition \ref{1.5.1} we know that there exists a subsequence of \((a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) which converges to some \(x_0 \in X\).
    But since \((a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) is a Cauchy sequence, by Lemma \ref{1.4.9} we know that \((a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) must also converge to \(x_0 \in X\), a contradiction.
    Thus \((X, d)\) is complete.

    Finally, we show that \((X, d)\) is bounded by contradiction.
    Suppose for sake of contradiction that \((X, d)\) is not bounded.
    Then by Definition \ref{1.5.3} \(\exists\ x_0 \in X\) such that \(\forall\ r \in \mathbf{R}^+\), we have \(X \not\subseteq B_{(X, d)}(x_0, r)\).
    In particular, we know that \(X \not\subseteq B_{(X, d)}(x_0, r)\) for all \(r \in \mathbf{Z}^+\).
    Let \((a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) be the sequence where \(a_n \in X \setminus B_{(X, d)}(x_0, r)\).
    Note that such sequence is well-defined by axiom of choice.
    Since \(a_n \in X \setminus B_{(X, d)}(x_0, r)\), by Definition \ref{1.2.1} we know that \(d(a_n, x_0) \geq r\).
    Since \((X, d)\) is compact, by Definition \ref{1.5.1} there exists a subsequence \((a_{n_j})_{j = 1}^\infty\) of \((a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty\) such that \((a_{n_j})_{j = 1}^\infty\) converges in \(X\).
    Let \(\lim_{j \to \infty} a_{n_j} = L\).
    By Definition \ref{1.1.14} we know that \(\forall\ \varepsilon \in \mathbf{R}^+\), \(\exists\ J \in \mathbf{Z}^+\) such that \(\forall\ j \geq J\), we have \(d(a_{n_j}, L) \leq \varepsilon\).
    In particular, \(\exists\ J \in \mathbf{Z}^+\) such that \(\forall\ j \geq J\), we have \(d(a_{n_j}, L) \leq 1\).
    We fix such \(J\) and let \(i = \max(J + 1, \ceil{d(L, x_0)} + 2)\).
    Then we have
    \begin{align*}
        d(a_{n_i}, x_0) & \leq d(a_{n_i}, L) + d(L, x_0) \\
                        & \leq 1 + d(L, x_0)             \\
                        & < 2 + d(L, x_0)
    \end{align*}
    and
    \begin{align*}
        d(a_{n_i}, x_0) & \geq n_i            \\
                        & \geq i              \\
                        & \geq d(L, x_0) + 2.
    \end{align*}
    But this means \(d(L, x_0) + 2 < d(L, x_0) + 2\), a contradiction.
    Thus \((X, d)\) is bounded.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Compact sets are closed and bounded]\label{1.5.6}
    Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space, and let \(Y\) be a compact subset of \(X\).
    Then \(Y\) is closed and bounded.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Since \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\) is compact, by Proposition \ref{1.5.5} we know that \((Y, d)\) is complete and bounded.
    Thus by Proposition \ref{1.4.12}(a) we know that \(Y\) is closed in \(X\).
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Heine-Borel theorem]\label{1.5.7}
    Let \((\mathbf{R}^n, d)\) be a Euclidean space with either the Euclidean metric, the taxicab metric, or the supnorm metric.
    Let \(E\) be a subset of \(\mathbf{R}^n\).
    Then \(E\) is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    By Exercise \ref{ex 1.1.6}, \ref{ex 1.1.7}, \ref{ex 1.1.9} we know that \((\mathbf{R}^n, d_{l^2})\), \((\mathbf{R}^n, d_{l^1})\), \((\mathbf{R}^n, d_{l^\infty})\) are metric spaces.
    By Corollary \ref{1.5.6} we know that if \((E, d_{l^1})\) is compact then \(E\) is a closed and bounded.
    Thus we only need to show that if \((E, d_{l^1})\) is closed and bounded then \(E\) is compact.

    Let \(E \subseteq \mathbf{R}^n\) and let \((E, d_{l^1})\) be closed and bounded.
    Since \(E \subseteq \mathbf{R}^n\), we know that \(\forall\ x \in E\), we have \(x\) in the form \(x = (x_1, \dots, x_n) = (x_i)_{i = 1}^n \in \mathbf{R}^n\).
    Let \(E_i\) be the set
    \[
        E_i = \{y \in \mathbf{R} | \exists\ x \in E : x_i = y\},
    \]
    i.e., \(E_i\) is the collection of \(i^{\text{th}}\) coordinate of all element \(x \in E\).
    Now we show that \(E_i\) is bounded and \(E_i\) is a subset of some closed interval \(C_i\).

    Since \((E, d_{l^1})\) is bounded, by Definition \ref{1.5.3} there exists a ball \(B_{(\mathbf{R}^n, d_{l^1})}(y, r)\) such that \(E \subseteq B_{(\mathbf{R}^n, d_{l^1})}(y, r)\).
    Then we have
    \begin{align*}
                 & E \subseteq B_{(\mathbf{R}^n, d_{l^1})}(y, r)                                                      \\
        \implies & \forall\ x \in E, x \in B_{(\mathbf{R}^n, d_{l^1})}(y, r)                                          \\
        \implies & d_{l^1}(x, y) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \abs*{x_i - y_i} < r           & \text{(by Definition \ref{1.2.1})} \\
        \implies & \abs*{x_i - y_i} < r \text{ for every } i \in \{1, \dots, n\}                                      \\
        \implies & x_i \in (y_i - r, y_i + r)                                                                         \\
        \implies & E_i \subseteq (y_i - r, y_i + r)                                                                   \\
        \implies & E_i \subseteq B_{(\mathbf{R}, d_{l^1})}(y_i, r).              & \text{(by Definition \ref{1.2.1})}
    \end{align*}
    Thus by Definition \ref{1.5.3} \((E_i, d_{l^1})\) is bounded.
    Let \(C_i = [y_i - r, y_i + r]\).
    Then we know that \(C_i\) is closed and \(E_i \subseteq (y_i - r, y_i + r) \subseteq C_i\).

    Let \(P(n)\) be the statement ``If \(F \subseteq \mathbf{R}^n\) satisfying \(F_i\) is bounded and \(F_i\) is a subset of some closed set \(C_i \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) for every \(i \in \{1, \dots, n\}\), then for any sequence in \(F\) there exists a subsequence which converges in \(\mathbf{R}^n\) with respect to \(d_{l^1}\)''.
    We use induction on \(n\) to show that \(P(n)\) is true \(\forall\ n \in \mathbf{Z}^+\).

    For \(n = 1\), since \(F = F_1\) is bounded and \(F\) is a subset of some closed set \(C_1 \subseteq \mathbf{R}\), by Heine-Borel theorem (Theorem 9.1.24 in Analysis I) on real line we know that for every sequence \((a^{(k)})_{k = 1}^\infty\) in \(F\), there exists a subsequence \((a^{(k_j)})_{j = 1}^\infty\) which converges in \(C_1 \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) with respect to \(d_{l^1}\).
    Thus the base case holds.

    Suppose inductively that \(P(n)\) is true for some \(n \geq 1\).
    Then we need to show that \(P(n + 1)\) is true.
    So suppose that \(F \subseteq \mathbf{R}^{n + 1}\) such that \(F_i\) is bounded and \(F_i\) is a subset of some closed set \(C_i \in \mathbf{R}\) for every \(i \in \{1, \dots, n, n + 1\}\).
    Let \((a^{(k)})_{k = 1}^\infty\) be any sequence in \(F\) and let \((b^{(k)})_{k = 1}^\infty\) be the sequence \(b^{(k)} = (a_1^{(k)}, \dots, a_n^{(k)})\), i.e., \(b^{(k)}\) is the first \(n\) coordinates of \(a^{(k)}\).
    Since \(b^{(k)} \in \mathbf{R}^n\) for all \(k \geq 1\) and \(b_i^{(k)} \in F_i\) for all \(i \in \{1, \dots, n\}\), by induction hypothesis there exists a subsequence \((b^{(k_j)})_{j = 1}^\infty\) which converges in \(\mathbf{R}^n\) with respect to \(d_{l^1}\).
    This means the first \(n\) coordinates of the sequence \((a^{(k_j)})_{j = 1}^\infty\) converges with respect to \(d_{l^1}\).
    Let \(L \in \mathbf{R}^n\) such that \(\lim_{j \to \infty} d(b^{(k_j)}, L) = 0\).
    By Lemma \ref{1.4.3} we know that every subsequence of \((b^{(k_j)})_{j = 1}^\infty\) also converges to \(L\).
    Since \((a_{n + 1}^{(k_j)})_{j = 1}^\infty\) is in \(F_{n + 1}\), by Heine-Borel theorem (Theorem 9.1.24 in Analysis I) on real line we know that there exists a subsequence \((a^{(k_{j_p})})_{p = 1}^\infty\) which converges in \(C_{n + 1} \subseteq \mathbf{R}\).
    Since \((b^{k_{j_p}})_{p = 1}^\infty\) converges to \(L\) with respect to \(d_{l^1}\), by Proposition \ref{1.1.18} we know that \((a^{(k_{j_p})})_{p = 1}^\infty\) converges in \(\mathbf{R}^{n + 1}\) with respect to \(d_{l^1}\).
    This close the induction.

    From the proof above we know that \(E \subseteq \mathbf{R}^n\) is closed and bounded implies \(E_i\) is bounded and \(E_i\) is a subset of some closed set \(C_i \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) for every \(i \in \{1, \dots, n\}\).
    Thus we know that for every sequence in \(E\) there exists a subsequence which converges in \(\mathbf{R}^n\).
    Since \(E\) is closed, by Proposition \ref{1.2.15}(b) we know that such subsequence must converges in \(E\).
    Thus by Definition \ref{1.5.1} \((E, d_{l^1})\) is compact.
    Since every sequence in \(E\) has a convergent subsequence with respect to \(d_{l^1}\), by Proposition \ref{1.1.18} we know that such subsequence also converges with respect to \(d_{l^2}\) and \(d_{l^\infty}\).
    Thus \((E, d_{l^2})\) and \((E, d_{l^\infty})\) are also compact when \((E, d_{l^1})\) is closed and bounded.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{1.5.8}
    Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space, and let \(Y\) be a compact subset of \(X\).
    Let \((V_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in A}\) be a collection of open sets in \(X\), and suppose that
    \[
        Y \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} V_{\alpha}.
    \]
    (i.e., the collection \((V_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in A}\) \emph{covers} \(Y\)).
    Then there exists a \emph{finite} subset \(F\) of \(A\) such that
    \[
        Y \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in F} V_{\alpha}.
    \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We assume for sake of contradiction that there does not exist any finite subset \(F\) of \(A\) for which \(Y \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in F} V_{\alpha}\).

    Let \(y\) be any element of \(Y\).
    Then \(y\) must lie in at least one of the sets \(V_{\alpha}\).
    Since each \(V_{\alpha}\) is open, by Proposition \ref{1.2.15}(a) there must therefore be an \(r > 0\) such that \(B_{(X, d)}(y, r) \subseteq V_{\alpha}\).
    Now let \(r(y)\) denote the quantity
    \[
        r(y) \coloneqq \sup\{r \in (0, \infty) : B_{(X, d)}(y, r) \subseteq V_{\alpha} \text{ for some } \alpha \in A\}.
    \]
    By the above discussion, we know that \(r(y) > 0\) for all \(y \in Y\).
    Now, let \(r_0\) denote the quantity
    \[
        r_0 \coloneqq \inf\{r(y) : y \in Y\}.
    \]
    Since \(r(y) > 0\) for all \(y \in Y\), we have \(r_0 \geq 0\).
    There are three cases: \(r_0 = 0\), \(0 < r_0 < \infty\) and \(r_0 = \infty\).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Case 1:
              \(r_0 = 0\).
              Then for every integer \(n \geq 1\), there is at least one point \(y\) in \(Y\) such that \(r(y) < 1 / n\) (otherwise the infimum cannot be \(0\)).
              We thus choose, for each \(n \geq 1\), a point \(y^{(n)}\) in \(Y\) such that \(r(y^{(n)}) < 1 / n\)
              (we can do this because of the axiom of choice, see Proposition 8.4.7 in Analysis I).
              In particular we have \(\lim_{n \to \infty} r(y^{(n)}) = 0\), by the squeeze test.
              The sequence \((y^{(n)})_{n = 1}^\infty\) is a sequence in \(Y\);
              since \(Y\) is compact, we can thus find a subsequence \((y^{(n_j)})_{j = 1}^\infty\) which converges to a point \(y_0 \in Y\).

              As before, we know that there exists some \(\alpha \in A\) such that \(y_0 \in V_{\alpha}\), and hence (since \(V_{\alpha}\) is open) there exists some \(\varepsilon > 0\) such that \(B(y_0, \varepsilon) \subseteq V_{\alpha}\).
              Since \(y^{(n_j)}\) converges to \(y_0\), there must exist an \(N \geq 1\) such that \(y^{(n_j)} \in B(y_0, \varepsilon / 2)\) for all \(n_j \geq N\).
              In particular, by the triangle inequality we have \(B(y^{(n_j)}, \varepsilon / 2) \subseteq B(y_0, \varepsilon)\), and thus \(B(y^{(n_j)}, \varepsilon / 2) \subseteq V_{\alpha}\).
              By definition of \(r(y^{(n_j)})\), this implies that \(r(y^{(n_j)}) \geq \varepsilon / 2\) for all \(n_j \geq N\).
              But this contradicts the fact that \(\lim_{n \to \infty} r(y^{(n)}) = 0\).
        \item Case 2:
              \(0 < r_0 < \infty\).
              In this case we now have \(r(y) > r_0 / 2\) for all \(y \in Y\).
              This implies that for every \(y \in Y\) there exists an \(\alpha \in A\) such that \(B(y, r_0 / 2) \subseteq V_{\alpha}\) (by the definition of \(r(y)\)).

              We now construct a sequence \(y^{(1)}, y^{(2)}, \dots\) by the following recursive procedure.
              We let \(y^{(1)}\) be any point in \(Y\).
              The ball \(B(y^{(1)}, r_0 / 2)\) is contained in one of the \(V_{\alpha}\) and thus cannot cover all of \(Y\), since we would then obtain a finite cover, a contradiction.
              Thus there exists a point \(y^{(2)}\) which does not lie in \(B(y^{(1)}, r_0 / 2)\), so in particular \(d(y^{(2)}, y^{(1)}) \geq r_0 / 2\).
              Choose such a point \(y^{(2)}\).
              The set \(B(y^{(1)}, r_0 / 2) \cup B(y^{(2)}, r_0 / 2)\) cannot cover all of \(Y\), since we would then obtain two sets \(V_{\alpha_1}\) and \(V_{\alpha_2}\) which covered \(Y\), a contradiction again.
              So we can choose a point \(y^{(3)}\) which does not lie in \(B(y^{(1)}, r_0 / 2) \cup B(y^{(2)}, r_0 / 2)\), so in particular \(d(y^{(3)}, y^{(1)}) \geq r_0 / 2\) and \(d(y^{(3)}, y^{(2)}) \geq r_0 / 2\).
              Continuing in this fashion we obtain a sequence \((y^{(n)})_{n = 1}^\infty\) in \(Y\) with the property that \(d(y^{(k)}, y^{(j)}) \geq r_0 / 2\) for all \(k > j\).
              In particular the sequence \((y^{(n)})_{n = 1}^\infty\) is not a Cauchy sequence, and in fact no subsequence of \((y^{(n)})_{n = 1}^\infty\) can be a Cauchy sequence either.
              But this contradicts the assumption that \(Y\) is compact (by Lemma \ref{1.4.7}).
        \item Case 3:
              \(r_0 = \infty\).
              For this case we argue as in Case 2, but replacing the role of \(r_0 / 2\) by (say) \(1\).
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{1.5.9}
    Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space, and let \(K_1, K_2, K_3, \dots\) be a sequence of non-empty compact subsets of \(X\) such that
    \[
        K_1 \supseteq K_2 \supseteq K_3 \supseteq \dots.
    \]
    Then the intersection \(\bigcap_{n = 1}^\infty K_n\) is non-empty.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Since \((K_n, d|_{K_n \times K_n})\) is compact for every \(n \geq 1\), by Corollary \ref{1.5.6} we know that \(K_n\) is closed with respect to \((K_1, d|_{K_1 \times K_1})\).
    Let \(V_n = K_1 \setminus K_n\) for every \(n \geq 1\).
    Then by Proposition \ref{1.2.15}(e) we know that \(V_n\) is open with respect to \((K_1, d|_{K_1 \times K_1})\).

    Suppose for sake of contradiction that \(\bigcap_{n = 1}^\infty K_n = \emptyset\).
    Since
    \[
        \bigcup_{n = 1}^\infty V_n = \bigcup_{n = 1}^\infty (K_1 \setminus K_n) = K_1 \setminus \bigg(\bigcap_{n = 1}^\infty K_n\bigg) = K_1
    \]
    and \(K_1\) is compact, by Theorem \ref{1.5.8} we know that there exists a finite set \(F \subseteq \mathbf{Z}^+\) such that
    \[
        K_1 \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in F} V_i.
    \]
    Since \(F\) is finite subset of \(\mathbf{Z}^+\), by well-ordering principle \(\min(F)\) is well-defined.
    Then we have
    \begin{align*}
                 & K_1 \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in F} V_i \subseteq \bigcup_{n = 1}^\infty V_i = K_1                                                          \\
        \implies & K_1 = \bigcup_{i \in F} V_i                                                                                                             \\
        \implies & K_1 = \bigcup_{i \in F} (K_1 \setminus K_i)                                                                                             \\
        \implies & K_1 = K_1 \setminus \bigg(\bigcap_{i \in F} K_i\bigg)                                                                                   \\
        \implies & \bigcap_{i \in F} K_i = \emptyset                                              & \text{(since \(\bigcap_{i \in F} K_i \subseteq K_1)\)} \\
        \implies & K_{\min(F)} = \emptyset.                                                       & \text{(since \(K_{\min(F)} = \bigcap_{i \in F} K_i)\)}
    \end{align*}
    But by hypothesis we know that \(K_{\min(F)} \neq \emptyset\), a contradiction.
    Thus \(\bigcap_{n = 1}^\infty K_n \neq \emptyset\).

\begin{theorem}\label{1.5.10}
    Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If \(Y\) is a compact subset of \(X\), and \(Z \subseteq Y\), then \(Z\) is compact if and only if \(Z\) is closed.
        \item If \(Y_1, \dots, Y_n\) are a finite collection of compact subsets of \(X\), then their union \(Y_1 \cup \dots \cup Y_n\) is also compact.
        \item Every finite subset of \(X\) (including the empty set) is compact.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}{(a)}
    By Corollary \ref{1.5.6} we know that if \(Z\) is compact then \(Z\) is closed.
    Now we show that if \(Z\) is closed then \(Z\) is compact.

    Since \(Y\) is a compact subset of \(X\) and \(Z \subseteq Y\), by Definition \ref{1.5.1} we know that every sequence \((z^{(n)})_{n = 1}^\infty\) in \(Z\) has a convergent subsequence \((z^{(n_j)})_{j = 1}^\infty\) which converges in \(Y\).
    Since \(Z\) is closed, by Proposition \ref{1.2.15}(b) we know that \((z^{(n_j)})_{j = 1}^\infty\) converges in \(Z\).
    Since \((z^{(n)})_{n = 1}^\infty\) is arbitrary, by Definition \ref{1.5.1} we know that \(Z\) is compact.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}{(b)}
    We use induction on \(n\) to show that \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^n Y_i\) is compact for every \(n \in \mathbf{Z}^+\).
    For \(n = 1\), we know that \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^1 Y_i = Y_1\) and by hypothesis \(Y_1\) is compact, thus the base case holds.
    Suppose inductively that \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^n Y_i\) is compact for some \(n \geq 1\).
    Then for \(n + 1\), we need to show that \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{n + 1} Y_i\) is compact.
    Let \((y^{(k)})_{k = 1}^\infty\) be a sequence in \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{n + 1} Y_i\).
    We now split into following two cases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If there exists a subsequence \((y^{(k_j)})_{j = 1}^\infty\) which elements are in \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^n Y_i\), then by induction hypothesis we know that \((y^{(k_j)})_{j = 1}^\infty\) converges in \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^n Y_i\).
              Since \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^n Y_i \subseteq \bigcup_{i = 1}^{n + 1} Y_i\), this means \((y^{(k_j)})_{j = 1}^\infty\) also converges in \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{n + 1} Y_i\).
        \item If there does not exist a subsequence \((y^{(k_j)})_{j = 1}^\infty\) which elements are in \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^n Y_i\), then there is only finitely many elements in \((y^{(k)})_{k = 1}^\infty\) which are in \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^n Y_i\).
              This means there exists a subsequence \((y^{(k_j)})_{j = 1}^\infty\) which elements are in \(Y_{n + 1}\).
              By hypothesis we know that \(Y_{n + 1}\) is compact, thus there exists a subsequence \((y^{(k_{j_p})})_{p = 1}^\infty\) of \((y^{(k_j)})_{j = 1}^\infty\) converges in \(Y_{n + 1}\).
              Since \(Y_{n + 1} \subseteq \bigcup_{i = 1}^{n + 1} Y_i\), we know that \((y^{(k_{j_p})})_{p = 1}^\infty\) also converges in \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{n + 1} Y_i\).
    \end{itemize}
    From all cases above we can conclude that there exists a subsequence in \((y^{(k)})_{k = 1}^\infty\) which converges in \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{n + 1} Y_i\).
    Thus by Definition \ref{1.5.1} \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{n + 1} Y_i\) is compact and this close the induction.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}{(c)}
    Let \(x_0 \in X\).
    Since \(\#\{x_0\} = 1\), every sequence \((x^{(n)})_{n = 1}^\infty\) in \(\{x_0\}\) must have \(x^{(n)} = x_0\) for every \(n \geq 1\).
    Thus every subsequence in \((x^{(n)})_{n = 1}^\infty\) converges to \(x_0\).
    By Definition \ref{1.5.1} we know that \(\{x_0\}\) is compact.
    Since \(x_0\) is arbitrary, we conclude that any singleton set is compact.

    Now let \(Y \neq \emptyset\) be a finite subset of \(X\).
    Let \(\alpha \in Y\) and let \(Y_{\alpha} = \{\alpha\}\).
    Since \(Y\) is finite and \(Y_{\alpha}\) is compact, by Theorem \ref{1.5.10}(b) we know that \(\bigcup_{\alpha \in Y} Y_{\alpha}\) is compact.

    Finally we show that \(\emptyset\) is compact.
    By Remark \ref{1.2.14} we know that \(\emptyset\) is closed.
    Let \(x_0 \in X\).
    Since \(\emptyset \subseteq \{x_0\}\) and \(\{x_0\}\) is compact, by Theorem \ref{1.5.10}(a) we know that \(\emptyset\) is compact.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}\label{ex 1.5.1}
    Show that Definitions 9.1.22 in Analysis I and Definition \ref{1.5.3} match when talking about subsets of the real line with the standard metric.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Let \(X \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) and is bounded by some \(M \in \mathbf{R}^+\).
    By Definition 9.1.22 in Analysis I this means \(X \subseteq [-M, M]\).
    Then we have \(X \subseteq (-M + 1, M + 1)\) and by Definition \ref{1.5.3} we know that \(X\) is bounded by \(B_{(\mathbf{R}, d_{l^1})}(0, M + 1)\).
    Thus the two definition are matched.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}\label{ex 1.5.4}
    Let \((\mathbf{R}, d)\) be the real line with the standard metric.
    Give an example of a continuous function \(f : \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}\), and an open set \(V \subseteq \mathbf{R}\), such that the image \(f(V) \coloneqq \{f(x) : x \in V\}\) of \(V\) is \emph{not} open.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Let \(f(x) = 1\) for all \(x \in \mathbf{R}\).
    Since \(f\) is a constant function, we know that \(f\) is continuous.
    By Definition \ref{1.2.1} and Proposition \ref{1.2.15}(c) we know that
    \[
        B_{(\mathbf{R}, d_{l^1})}(1, 1) = (0, 2)
    \]
    is a open set.
    Similarly by Proposition \ref{1.2.15}(c) we know that
    \[
        f((0, 2)) = \{1\} = \{f(x) \in \mathbf{R} : d_{l^1}(f(x), 0) = \abs*{f(x)} \leq 1\} = [1, 1]
    \]
    is a closed set (which is a closed ball).
    By Proposition \ref{1.2.15}(a) we know that \(\{1\}\) is not a open set since we cannot find an \(r > 0\) such that \(B_{(\mathbf{R}, d_{l^1})}(1, r) \subseteq \{1\}\).
    Thus such \(f\) satisfy the requirements.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}\label{ex 1.5.5}
    Let \((\mathbf{R}, d)\) be the real line with the standard metric.
    Give an example of a continuous function \(f : \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}\), and a closed set \(F \subseteq \mathbf{R}\), such that \(f(F)\) is \emph{not} closed.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Let \(f(x) = 2^x\) for all \(x \in \mathbf{R}\).
    We know that \(2^x\) is continuous on \((-\infty, \infty)\).
    Let \(F = (-\infty, 0]\).
    If \(x_0 \in F\) is a boundary point, then by Definition \ref{1.2.5} we must have \(B(x_0, r) \not\subseteq F\) and \(B(x_0, r) \cap F \neq \emptyset\) for every \(r \in \mathbf{R}^+\).
    Thus the only boundary point is \(0\).
    Since \(0\) is the only boundary point of \(F\) and \(0 \in F\), by Definition \ref{1.2.12} we know that \(F\) is closed.
    Since
    \[
        f(F) = f((-\infty, 0]) = (0, 1]
    \]
    and \(0 \notin (0, 1)\), by Definition \ref{1.2.12} we know that \(f(F)\) is not closed.
    Thus such \(f\) satisfy the requirements.

    For each natural number \(n\), let \(e_j^{(n)} = (e_j^{(n)})_{j = 0}^\infty\) be the sequence in \(X\) such that \(e_j^{(n)} \coloneqq 1\) when \(n = j\) and \(e_j^{(n)} \coloneqq 0\) when \(n \neq j\).
    Show that the set \(\{e^{(n)} : n \in \mathbf{N}\}\) is a closed and bounded subset of \(X\), but is not compact.
    (This is despite the fact that \((X, d_{l^1})\) is even a complete metric space
    - a fact which we will not prove here.
    The problem is that not that \(X\) is incomplete, but rather that it is ``infinite-dimensional'', in a sense that we will not discuss here.)

    \[
        d(x_0, x) = \inf\{d(x_0, y) : y \in E\},

    (This property is known as the \emph{finite intersection property}.)
