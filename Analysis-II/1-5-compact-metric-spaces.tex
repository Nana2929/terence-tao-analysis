\section{Compact metric spaces}\label{sec 1.5}

\begin{definition}[Compactness]\label{1.5.1}
    A metric space \((X, d)\) is said to be \emph{compact} iff every sequence in \((X, d)\) has at least one convergent subsequence.
    A subset \(Y\) of a metric space \(X\) is said to be \emph{compact} if the subspace \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\) is compact.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{1.5.2}
    The notion of a set \(Y\) being compact is \emph{intrinsic}, in the sense that it only depends on the metric function \(d|_{Y \times Y}\) restricted to \(Y\), and not on the choice of the ambient space \(X\).
    The notions of completeness in Definition \ref{1.4.10}, and of boundedness below in Definition 1.5.3, are also intrinsic, but the notions of open and closed are not
    (see the discussion in Section \ref{sec 1.3}).
