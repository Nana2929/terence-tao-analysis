\section{Compact metric spaces}\label{sec 1.5}

\begin{definition}[Compactness]\label{1.5.1}
    A metric space \((X, d)\) is said to be \emph{compact} iff every sequence in \((X, d)\) has at least one convergent subsequence.
    A subset \(Y\) of a metric space \(X\) is said to be \emph{compact} if the subspace \((Y, d|_{Y \times Y})\) is compact.
