\section{Continuous functions}\label{sec 2.1}

\begin{definition}[Continuous functions]\label{2.1.1}
    Let \((X, d_X)\) be a metric space, and let \((Y, d_Y)\) be another metric space, and let \(f : X \to Y\) be a function.
    If \(x_0 \in X\), we say that \(f\) is \emph{continuous at \(x_0\)} iff for every \(\varepsilon > 0\), there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that \(d_Y(f(x), f(x_0 )) < \varepsilon\) whenever \(d_X(x, x_0) < \delta\).
    We say that \(f\) is \emph{continuous} iff it is continuous at every point \(x \in X\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{2.1.2}
    Continuous functions are also sometimes called \emph{continuous maps}.
    Mathematically, there is no distinction between the two terminologies.
