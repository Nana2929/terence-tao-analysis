\section{Continuous functions}\label{sec 2.1}

\begin{definition}[Continuous functions]\label{2.1.1}
    Let \((X, d_X)\) be a metric space, and let \((Y, d_Y)\) be another metric space, and let \(f : X \to Y\) be a function.
    If \(x_0 \in X\), we say that \(f\) is \emph{continuous at \(x_0\)} iff for every \(\varepsilon > 0\), there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that \(d_Y(f(x), f(x_0 )) < \varepsilon\) whenever \(d_X(x, x_0) < \delta\).
    We say that \(f\) is \emph{continuous} iff it is continuous at every point \(x \in X\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{2.1.2}
    Continuous functions are also sometimes called \emph{continuous maps}.
    Mathematically, there is no distinction between the two terminologies.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}\label{2.1.3}
    If \(f : X \to Y\) is continuous, and \(K\) is any subset of \(X\), then the restriction \(f|_K : K \to Y\) of \(f\) to \(K\) is also continuous.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
    Let \(x_0 \in K\).
    Suppose that \(f : X \to Y\) is continuous at \(x_0\) in \((X, d_X)\).
    Then we have
    \begin{align*}
                 & f : X \to Y \text{ is continuous at } x_0 \text{ in } (X, d_X)                                                                         \\
        \implies & \forall\ \varepsilon \in \mathbf{R}^+, \exists\ \delta \in \mathbf{R}^+ :                                                              \\
                 & \Big(\forall\ x \in X, d_X(x, x_0) < \delta \implies d_Y\big(f(x), f(x_0) < \varepsilon\big)\Big) & \text{(by definition \ref{2.1.1})} \\
        \implies & \forall\ \varepsilon \in \mathbf{R}^+, \exists\ \delta \in \mathbf{R}^+ :                                                              \\
                 & \Big(\forall\ x \in K, d_X(x, x_0) < \delta \implies d_Y\big(f(x), f(x_0) < \varepsilon\big)\Big) & (K \subseteq X)                    \\
        \implies & f|_K : K \to Y \text{ is continuous at } x_0 \text{ in } (K, d_X|_{K \times K}).                  & \text{(by definition \ref{2.1.1})}
    \end{align*}

    Now suppose that \(f : X \to Y\) is continuous on \(X\) in \((X, d_X)\).
    Then we have
    \begin{align*}
                 & f : X \to Y \text{ is continuous in } (X, d_X)                                                                              \\
        \implies & \forall\ x_0 \in X, f \text{ is continuous at } x_0 \text{ in } (X, d_X)               & \text{(by Definition \ref{2.1.1})} \\
        \implies & \forall\ x_0 \in K, f \text{ is continuous at } x_0 \text{ in } (K, d_X|_{K \times K}) & (K \subseteq X)                    \\
        \implies & f|_K : K \to Y \text{ is continuous in } (K, d_X|_{K \times K}).                       & \text{(by Definition \ref{2.1.1})}
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}
