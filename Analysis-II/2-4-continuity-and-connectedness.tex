\section{Continuity and connectedness}\label{sec 2.4}

\begin{definition}[Connected spaces]\label{2.4.1}
    Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space.
    We say that \(X\) is \emph{disconnected} iff there exist disjoint non-empty open sets \(V\) and \(W\) in \(X\) such that \(V \cup W = X\).
    (Equivalently, \(X\) is disconnected if and only if \(X\) contains a non-empty proper subset which is simultaneously closed and open, see Proposition \ref{1.2.15}(e).)
    We say that \(X\) is \emph{connected} iff it is non-empty and not disconnected.
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
    We declare the empty set \(\emptyset\) as being special
    - it is neither connected nor disconnected;
    one could think of the empty set as ``unconnected''.
