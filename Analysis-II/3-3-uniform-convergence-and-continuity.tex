\section{Uniform convergence and continuity}\label{sec 3.3}

\begin{theorem}[Uniform limits preserve continuity I]\label{3.3.1}
    Suppose \((f^{(n)})_{n = 1}^\infty\) is a sequence of functions from one metric space \((X, d_X)\) to another \((Y, d_Y)\), and suppose that this sequence converges uniformly to another function \(f : X \to Y\).
    Let \(x_0\) be a point in \(X\).
    If the functions \(f^{(n)}\) are continuous at \(x_0\) for each \(n\), then the limiting function \(f\) is also continuous at \(x_0\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We have
    \begin{align*}
                 & (f^{(n)})_{n = 1}^\infty \text{ converges uniformly to } f \text{ on } X                                                     \\
                 & \text{with respect to } d_Y                                                                                                  \\
        \implies & \forall\ \varepsilon \in \mathbf{R}^+, \exists\ N \in \mathbf{Z}^+ :                                                         \\
                 & \forall\ n \geq N, \forall\ x \in X, d_Y\big(f_n(x), f(x)\big) < \frac{\varepsilon}{3}. & \text{(by Definition \ref{3.2.7})}
    \end{align*}
    We choose one pair of \(\varepsilon\) and \(N\).
    For each \(n \in \mathbf{Z}^+\), since \(f_n\) is continuous at \(x_0\) from \((X, d_X)\) to \((Y, d_Y)\), by Definition \ref{2.1.1} we have
    \begin{align*}
                 & \forall\ n \geq N, f_n \text{ is continuous at } x_0 \text{ from } (X, d_X) \text{ to } (Y, d_Y)                                                                            \\
        \implies & \forall\ n \geq N, \exists\ \delta \in \mathbf{R}^+ :                                                                                                                       \\
                 & \Big(\forall\ x \in X, d_X(x, x_0) < \delta \implies d_Y\big(f_n(x), f_n(x_0)\big) < \frac{\varepsilon}{3}\Big)                                                             \\
        \implies & \forall\ n \geq N, \exists\ \delta \in \mathbf{R}^+ :                                                                                                                       \\
                 & \Big(\forall\ x \in X, d_X(x, x_0) < \delta \implies d_Y\big(f(x), f(x_0)\big)                                                                                              \\
                 & \leq d_Y\big(f(x), f_n(x)\big) + d_Y\big(f_n(x), f_n(x_0)\big) + d_Y\big(f_n(x_0), f(x_0)\big) < \frac{\varepsilon}{3} + \frac{\varepsilon}{3} + \frac{\varepsilon}{3}\Big) \\
        \implies & \forall\ n \geq N, \exists\ \delta \in \mathbf{R}^+ :                                                                                                                       \\
                 & \Big(\forall\ x \in X, d_X(x, x_0) < \delta \implies d_Y\big(f(x), f(x_0)\big) < \varepsilon.
    \end{align*}
    Since \(\varepsilon\) is arbitrary, by Definition \ref{2.1.1} we know that \(f\) is continuous at \(x_0\) from \((X, d_X)\) to \((Y, d_Y)\).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Uniform limits preserve continuity II]\label{3.3.2}
    Let \((f^{(n)})_{n = 1}^\infty\) be a sequence of functions from one metric space \((X, d_X)\) to another \((Y, d_Y)\), and suppose that this sequence converges uniformly to another function \(f : X \to Y\).
    If the functions \(f^{(n)}\) are continuous on \(X\) for each \(n\), then the limiting function \(f\) is also continuous on \(X\).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}[Interchange of limits and uniform limits]\label{3.3.3}
    Let
    \((X, d_X)\) and \((Y, d_Y)\) be metric spaces, with \(Y\) complete, and let \(E\) be a subset of \(X\).
    Let \((f^{(n)})_{n = 1}^\infty\) be a sequence of functions from \(E\) to \(Y\), and suppose that this sequence converges uniformly in \(E\) to some function \(f : E \to Y\).
    Let \(x_0 \in X\) be an adherent point of \(E\), and suppose that for each \(n\) the limit \(\lim_{x \to x_0 ; x \in E} f^{(n)}(x)\) exists.
    Then the limit \(\lim_{x \to x_0 ; x \in E} f(x)\) also exists, and is equal to the limit of the sequence \(\big(\lim_{x \to x_0 ; x \in E} f^{(n)}(x)\big)_{n = 1}^\infty\);
    in other words we have the interchange of limits
    \[
        \lim_{n \to \infty} \lim_{x \to x_0 ; x \in E} f^{(n)}(x) = \lim_{x \to x_0 ; x \in E} \lim_{n \to \infty} f^{(n)}(x).
    \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}\label{3.3.4}
    Let \((f^{(n)})_{n = 1}^\infty\) be a sequence of continuous functions from one metric space \((X, d_X)\) to another \((Y, d_Y)\), and suppose that this sequence converges uniformly to another function \(f : X \to Y\).
    Let \(x^{(n)}\) be a sequence of points in \(X\) which converge to some limit \(x\).
    Then \(f^{(n)}(x^{(n)})\) converges (in \(Y\)) to \(f(x)\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}[Bounded functions]\label{3.3.5}
    A function \(f : X \to Y\) from one metric space \((X, d_X)\) to another \((Y, d_Y)\) is \emph{bounded} if \(f(X)\) is a bounded set, i.e., there exists a ball \(B_{(Y, d_Y)}(y_0, R)\) in \(Y\) such that \(f(x) \in B_{(Y, d_Y)}(y_0, R)\) for all \(x \in X\).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Uniform limits preserve boundedness]\label{3.3.6}
    Let \((f^{(n)})_{n = 1}^\infty\) be a sequence of functions from one metric space \((X, d_X)\) to another \((Y, d_Y)\), and suppose that this sequence converges uniformly to another function \(f : X \to Y\).
    If the functions \(f^{(n)}\) are bounded on \(X\) for each \(n\), then the limiting function \(f\) is also bounded on \(X\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}\label{3.3.7}
    The above propositions sound very reasonable, but one should caution that it only works if one assumes uniform convergence;
    pointwise convergence is not enough.
